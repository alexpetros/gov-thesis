Wohlforth

At the times during this project when I struggled the most, my parents did what they have done for me since I was three---give me something new to read. My mom found the book that inspired my conclusions and my dad found the quotes that prove it true. Their influence can be found in the copy-editing, the citations, the theory, the evidence, and the fact that this thesis exists at all.

Mom, Dad, Sophia, Andrew---thank you. I love you very much.
