The Computer Security Institute and the FBI jointly estimate that financial losses attributed to malicious attack amounted to \$378 million in 2000. International Law clearly permits a state to respond in self-defense when attacked by another state through the Internet, however, such attacks may not always rise to the scope, duration, and intensity threshold of an armed attack that may justify a use of force in self-defense.},

  abstract = {"While getting into his car on the evening of February 16, 1978, the chief of the CIA's Moscow station was handed an envelope by an unknown Russian. Its contents stunned the Americans: details of top-secret Soviet research and development in military technology that was totally unknown to the United States. From 1979 to 1985, Adolf Tolkachev, an engineer at a military research center, cracked open the secret Soviet military research establishment, using his access to hand over tens of thousands of pages of material about the latest advances in aviation technology, alerting the Americans to possible developments years in the future. He was one of the most productive and valuable spies ever to work for the United States in the four decades of global confrontation with the Soviet Union. Tolkachev took enormous personal risks, but so did his CIA handlers. Moscow station was a dangerous posting to the KGB's backyard. The CIA had long struggled to recruit and run agents in Moscow, and Tolkachev became a singular breakthrough. With hidden cameras and secret codes, and in face-to-face meetings with CIA case officers in parks and on street corners, Tolkachev and the CIA worked to elude the feared KGB. Drawing on previously secret documents obtained from the CIA, as well as interviews with participants, Hoffman reveals how the depredations of the Soviet state motivated one man to master the craft of spying against his own nation until he was betrayed to the KGB by a disgruntled former CIA trainee. No one has ever told this story before in such detail, and Hoffman's deep knowledge of spycraft, the Cold War, and military technology makes him uniquely qualified to bring readers this real-life espionage thriller"--Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {Documents such as the Geneva (1949) and Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907) that have clearly outlined the rules of engagement for warfare find themselves challenged by the presence of a new arena: cyber. Considering the potential nature of these offenses, operations taking place in the realm of cyber cannot simply be generalized as "cyberwarfare,” as they may also be acts of cyber-espionage, cyberterrorism, cyber-sabaotge, etc. Cyber-attacks, such as those on Estonia in 2007, have begun to test the limits of NATO's Article 5 and the UN Charter's Article 2(4) against the use of force. What defines "force" as it relates to cyber, and what kind of response is merited in the case of uncertainty regarding attribution? In 2009, NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence commissioned a group of experts to publish a study on the application of international law to cyber-warfare. This document, the Tallinn Manual, was published in 2013 as a non-binding exercise to stimulate discussion on the codification of international law on the subject. After analysis, this paper concludes that the Tallinn Manual classifies the 2010 Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear program as an illegal act of force. The purpose of this paper is the following: (1) to analyze the historical and technical background of cyber-warfare, (2) to evaluate the Tallinn Manual as it relates to the justification cyber-warfare, and (3) to examine the applicability of the Tallinn Manual in a case study of a historical example of a cyber-attacks.},

  volume = {18},
  abstract = {Peacetime espionage is an incredibly important and common occurrence in modern international relations, yet its legal status is far from clear. This Comment explores the practice’s legal background, as well as the arguments for and against its legality. While there can be many benefits to peacetime espionage, and while few countries have “clean hands,” it seems unworkable to overcome the presupposition that most espionage is an “intervention” as defined by the ICJ in Nicaragua v. U.S., even if the prohibition on espionage is often unenforced. With the conclusion that most peacetime espionage is likely illegal under international law, this Comment attempts to ascertain how this prohibition can be enforced. After examining the ICJ’s prohibition on “intervention,” the ICC’s jurisdiction over “crimes of aggression,” the U.N. Security Council’s prohibition on “force,” and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime, no panacea was found. Therefore, in situations where domestic law is unable to effectively enforce this prohibition, this Comment argues that countermeasures are the best way to deter state actors from engaging in acts of peacetime espionage. However, in certain situations where extreme versions of peacetime espionage are carried out upon weak countries unable to make use of countermeasures, reliance on the ICJ, the ICC, the U.N. Security Council, or the Council of Europe may be feasible.},

The goal is to identify a design for empirical research to examine associative connotations of norms that come to the fore when norms are contested in situations of governance beyond-the-state and especially in crises. If cultural practices shape experience and expectations, they need to be identiﬁed and made ‘account-able’ based on empirical research. To that end, the proposed qualitative approach centres on individually enacted meaning-in-use. The framework comprises norm-types, conditions of contestation, types of divergence and opposition-deriving as a speciﬁc interview evaluation technique. Section one situates the problem of contestation in the ﬁeld of constructivist research on norms. Section two introduces distinctive conditions of contestation and types of norms. Section three details the methodology of conducting and evaluating interviews and presents the technique of opposition-deriving with a view to reconstructing the structure of meaning-in-use. Section four concludes with an outlook to follow-up research.},

The United States has raised objections to certain types of cyber espionage activity, notably: (1) Chinese economically-motivated cyber espionage; (2) the (feared) transfer of data taken from the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and provided to criminals; and (3) Russian doxing attacks, particularly against the Democratic National Committee (DNC). In effect, the United States has been edging towards advocating a new class of norms for cyber espionage – countries may carry it out, but not use the results for other than traditional intelligence purposes, that is for informing national security decisionmaking. Other forms of cyber espionage may come to be viewed as unacceptable, notably the uses of cyber espionage to enable cyber attacks on critical infrastructure.},

To use these weapons with greatest effect, the US military seeks to integrate them into its operational toolkit within a common framework of principles that apply to all weapons. While the US military has had decades of operational experience formulating rules of engagement (ROEs) for kinetic weapons, several characteristics of operations in cyberspace complicate the formulation of cyberspeciﬁc ROEs. Sensitive issues related to command and control and escalation of force play important roles in shaping cyber-speciﬁc ROEs. The article’s conclusion is that a paucity of similar experience with cyber operations will hamper the formulation of ROEs for cyber weapons unless special efforts are taken to impart such experience to civilian leaders and military commanders.},

  abstract = {Cyberspace appears to offer limitless possibilities for collaboration and economic opportunity in the twenty-first century, but cyber-attacks, breaches of privacy, and security threats also have become commonplace. In the face of these challenges, a number of governments have been locked in debates over the future of cyberspace governance, including the Russian Republic, the People’s Republic of China, and the United States. This study examines the ongoing contestation of the international normative architecture for cyberspace, with a focus on the United States’ role as a norm ‘antipreneur’, seeking to defend the status quo multi-stakeholder norm for a more open Internet from entrepreneurial efforts by Russia and China to establish multilateral governance with ‘cyber-sovereignty’. Drawing on recent advances in constructivist theory, the study explores antipreneurial strategies to contest efforts by entrepreneurs to introduce new norms, as well as implications for norm development and change. Process tracing is employed to examine cyberspace governance debates. The study concludes by discussing prospects for an International Code of Conduct for Cyberspace, as well as theoretical and political implications of antipreneurship in modern norm contestations.},

  title = {Norm Transformation and the Institutionalization of Targeted Killing in the {{US}}},
  abstract = {This article explains the emergence and institutionalization of the US’s targeted killing practices as a case of norm transformation. I argue that international and domestic US prohibitions on assassination have not disappeared, but have changed as a result of practitioner-led changes in the conventions, technologies, and bureaucratic structures governing the use of force in counterterrorism activities. After discussing the limits of alternative explanations, and drawing inspiration from practice theory, pragmatist social theory, and relational sociology, I posit three causal mechanisms as responsible for the transformation: convention reorientation, which was the redefinition of targeted killing to distinguish it from assassination; technological revision, which was the development and use of unmanned aerial vehicles (“drones”) to bypass normative and strategic concerns over precision; and network synthesis, which was the support of the Bush administration and especially of the Obama administration, overruling dissenters from within the Central Intelligence Agency (who were often very highly placed). I trace the processes by which these mechanisms operated and interacted in simultaneous and mutually reinforcing ways from the start of the millennium until now. Finally, I discuss some of the ways in which this contributes to institutional analysis and the study of norm change more generally, and, in particular, how it considers the role of technology and the reciprocity of means and ends.},

Some strategists and policy makers believe that acts of cyberterrorism, especially by non-state actors, may prove to be undeterrable. Yet the leadership of both state and non-state actors tend to act rationally and function strategically, and therefore they can, in fact, be deterred to some degree. Helping to shape the legitimate options following a significant cyberattack, the Law of Armed Conflict has salient considerations for the deterrence of cyberterrorism, particularly the principles of military necessity and lawful targeting. Furthermore, when considered holistically and using all available means, deterrence combined with dissuasion activities can lessen the likelihood of cyberterrorism, while mitigating any consequences should such a cyberattack actually occur.},

Yet, both sides proclaim that they subscribe to an international consensus that cyber operations must be subjected to the rule of law. Against this background, the article examines ﬁve key aspects of the rule of law in cyberspace, which are ordinarily understood as areas of contention: (1) preferred method of identiﬁcation and development of international law; (2) competing models of cyberspace governance; (3) application of sovereignty to cyberspace; (4) question of militarization of cyberspace; and (5) legality of cyber espionage. Our analysis demonstrates that it is inaccurate to view China and the West as sharply divided and competing camps. Rather, the emerging picture reveals a web of relationships and views that reﬂect an overall trajectory of convergence, even if modest in scope and velocity.},

While many States, led by the United States, take the view that existing international law, including the law of armed conflict, is sufficient to cover cyberspace (“law of the horse”), such a view is being overtaken by reality. The Sony hack allegedly by North Korea is only the latest, and most blatant, in the long history of State activity in cyberspace. The current architecture of cyberspace makes it very attractive for States to pursue their national interests via this domain in a manner that is easily denied. With such a state of affairs persisting into the foreseeable future, it is very likely that international law will soon be sidelined or ignored by States as they seek to respond to cyber activity undertaken by other States (“law of the submarine”). With most, if not all, State-sponsored cyber activity not rising to the level of a use of force, countermeasures are one of the most viable international law tools for States to respond to State-sponsored cyber activity. Countermeasures, however, is the international law concept most at risk of being ignored by States. The customary international law of countermeasures imposes many conditions and limitations on their use, conditions and limitations that States will be inclined to ignore because they can under cyberspace’s current architecture. Fortunately, the customary international law of countermeasures remains fluid enough that it can be sufficiently adapted to accommodate State behavior in cyberspace while still accounting for the international law interests underlying countermeasures.},

In this study, we use PACARD to evaluate the effectiveness of card-based design on personalized adaptive mobile learning. An empirical study was conducted among 2774 online users for three months to evaluate PACARD's effect on engaging active recall, thus, enhancing memory retention. We also observed how our adaptive mechanism meets user preference. In terms of memory retention and users' preference in PACARD, it results in better retention and it also enabled the learning items to be more appealing to the users as the users related to their own learning progress.},

The three reasons are: deterrence through infiltration of critical infrastructure; militarytechnological espionage to gain military knowledge; and industrial espionage to gain economic advantage. China has a greater interest in using cyberspace offensively than other actors, such as the United States, since it has more to gain from spying on and deterring the United States than the other way around. The article also documents China's progress in cyber warfare and shows how it works as an extension of its traditional strategic thinking and the current debate within the country. Several examples of cyber attacks traceable to China are also presented. This includes cyber intrusions on a nuclear arms laboratory, attacks on defense ministries (including the Joint Strike Fighter and an airbase) and the U.S. electric grid, as well as the current Google affair, which has proved to be a small part of a broader attack that also targeted the U.S. Government. There are, however, certain constraints that qualify the image of China as an aggressive actor in cyberspace. Some believe that China itself is the victim of just as many attacks from other states. Furthermore, certain actors in the United States and the West have an interest in overestimating China's capabilities in cyberspace in order to maintain their budgets.},

By looking at a collection of redacted and declassified CIA documents, this article analyzes the media apparatus of the spy plane, which materialized during the Cold War as the U-2 jet glider. This study delves into how a specific and professional type of knowledge practice known as “intelligence” has shaped and been shaped by aerial media politics and centralized its own vein of critical visuality. At once initiating a timely shift toward a more technological way to produce strategic knowledge, the CIA simultaneously situated the spy plane as a new media apparatus within the human parameters of planning, piloting, and interpretation. This article examines the professional deliberative practices that arose, largely within the CIA and centered on the U-2, to support aerial espionage and institutionalize analysis of its imagery to argue that the spy plane’s media ushered in a rupture in photoreconnaissance analytics as well as technologies.},

  abstract = {The 1955 UN-sponsored Geneva Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy quickly became a symbol for the re-establishment of international scientific cooperation and knowledge-exchange. It was the first large-scale meeting attended by Soviet atomic energy specialists – so called atomshchiki – after years of isolation. Starting from this vast gathering, this article examines the limited internationalization of Soviet nuclear science, stressing the importance of personal encounters of and direct contacts between scientists from both sides of the Iron Curtain. Focusing on the role of the Soviet Academy of Sciences as one of the most influential institutions within the creation and negotiation of border-crossing relationships regarding nonmilitary uses of atomic energy, it provides insights into the growing international entanglements of Soviet nuclear research. The establishment of an International Atomic Energy Agency in 1957 marked yet another milestone in this process. One of the Agency’s main purposes was to provide a diplomatic platform for the discussion of problems posed by the nuclear age. By analyzing professional contacts of Soviet scientists and science administrators with their Western counterparts, this article shows how they sought acknowledgment both from an international scientific community and from the Party and state authorities. Referring to an atmosphere of mutual understanding experienced during a total of four major atomic energy conferences in Geneva between 1955 and 1971, Soviet atomshchiki did much to foster knowledge exchange across the Iron Curtain and to establish channels of communication to the West which remained open even in times of growing political tensions.},

A uniquely comprehensive and rich account of the Soviet intelligence services, Jonathan Haslam's Near and Distant Neighbors charts the labyrinthine story of Soviet intelligence from the October Revolution to the end of the Cold War. Previous histories have focused on the KGB, leaving military intelligence and the special service--which specialized in codes and ciphers--lurking in the shadows. Drawing on previously neglected Russian sources, Haslam reveals how both were in fact crucial to the survival of the Soviet state. This was especially true after Stalin's death in 1953, as the Cold War heated up and dedicated Communist agents the regime had relied upon--Klaus Fuchs, the Rosenbergs, Donald Maclean--were betrayed. In the wake of these failures, Khrushchev and his successors discarded ideological recruitment in favor of blackmail and bribery. The tactical turn was so successful that we can draw only one conclusion: the West ultimately triumphed despite, not because of, the espionage war. In bringing to light the obscure inhabitants of an undercover intelligence world, Haslam offers a surprising and unprecedented portrayal of Soviet success that is not only fascinating but also essential to understanding Vladimir Putin's power today"--},

In this article, the author analyses that debate, and explains a third approach developed during the Tallinn Manual project. He concludes by suggesting that the Tallinn Manual approach best approximates the contemporary law given the increasing value which societies are attributing to cyber activities.},

  abstract = {The Russian government is accused of hacking emails circulating among senior members of Hilary Clinton’s campaign team to support President Trump’s election in 2016. This was not the first time the United States was the target of massive cyber espionage: The Chinese government is believed to have gained sensitive information on 22.1 million US government employees through “cyber intrusions” in 2014. This Article will examine whether cyber espionage of this kind is unlawful under public international law and will conclude that it is. Specifically, such espionage can result in a violation of territorial sovereignty and will likely violate the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States. Yet, based on the controversial “clean-hands-doctrine,” past US actions in the realms of cyber espionage and intervention may well invalidate any claims it asserts against Russia or China.},
