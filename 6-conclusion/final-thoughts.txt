Here is what you should take away from the thesis:
    - states refrain from punishing each other for attempting espionage in order to preserve the practice
    - for new technological advancements, the United States made concerted efforts to have those norms apply
    - even though reciprocal capabilities were not always immediately available, the USSR esentially went along
    - them

Can I say that the norm is a net good?


* introduction
    - we know that there is a norm around reducing the response, especially when you consider how much harm was done
    - we know how that norm was deployed in the case of new technologies
    - we know that it's actively promoted

* so WHY does that norm exist?
    - what are policymakers relying on when they promote the norm? why do have faith that it's a thing they can encourage?
    - defensive realism
    - civilian intelligence vs military intelligence
    - bias towards knowing more
    - in the nuclear age, premium on reducing miscalculation

* when does the norm work, and when does it fail?
    - mutual technological capabilities (or close to it)
    - information-only
    - do not abuse the dual-use

* how it does or does not apply to cyber today
    - make the case that it's connected
    - then talk about what we can learn
    - there probably should have been more stuxnets

* US should promote a "don't militarize space norm"
The norm is more precarious than it might seem, things that threaten it


* defensive realism... but what if the United States is not defensive?
    - decapitating strike?
    - then the hypothetical where it is
